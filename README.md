# Hungarian Lottery problem

The idea is to have a winners table and update the table while reading the lines
from the data file without closing it for the next lottery numbers.

The most efficient point in the solution is the winners table, the number of
matches in the winner table of the current player is the index of the winners table.

Run the below command to run the code:

```bash
python3 <players_data_file>
```
